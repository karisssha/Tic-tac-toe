### 2. The Architecture

The program is structured into three main classes, each with well-defined responsibilities:

1️⃣ Board – Handles the game logic:
Initializes the board with numbers (1-9).
Handles moves and updates the board.
Determines if there is a winner or a tie.

2️⃣ Players – Handles user input:
Requests the position to place the checker (X or O).
Verifies that the input is valid.
Highlights each player's checker with colors (X in green, O in purple).

3️⃣ TicTacToe (Main) – Controls the flow of the game:
Alternates turns between players.
Verifies if the game is over.
Displays win or tie messages with visual effects on the terminal.
